Despite a record-setting Hollywood career that included roles in the “Fast & Furious” franchises as well as “Pain & Gain,” “Hercules” and “San Andreas,” The Rock still returned to the ring against John Cena in the main event of WrestleMania XXVIII, won the WWE Championship from CM Punk in 2013 and defended it against Cena once again at WrestleMania 29 — all while proving to WWE’s newest generation of fans what their elders already knew: That he truly is The Most Electrifying Man in All of Entertainment.
